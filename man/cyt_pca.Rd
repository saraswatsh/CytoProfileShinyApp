\title{Analyze Data with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Cytokines.}
\usage{
cyt_pca(
  data,
  group_col = NULL,
  group_col2 = NULL,
  pca_colors = NULL,
  ellipse = FALSE,
  comp_num = 2,
  scale = NULL,
  pch_values = NULL,
  style = NULL,
  output_file = NULL,
  progress = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing cytokine data.}

\item{group_col}{Character. The name of the column containing the grouping information.}

\item{group_col2}{Character. The name of the second column containing the grouping information.
If one is missing, the provided column is used for both.}

\item{pca_colors}{A vector of pca_colors corresponding to the groups. If NULL, a palette is generated.}

\item{ellipse}{Logical. If TRUE, a 95\% confidence ellipse is drawn on the individuals plot.}

\item{comp_num}{Numeric. Number of principal components to compute and display. Default is 2.}

\item{scale}{Character. If "log2", a log2 transformation is applied (excluding factor columns).}

\item{pch_values}{A vector of plotting symbols.}

\item{style}{Character. If "3d" (case insensitive) and comp_num equals 3, a 3D scatter plot is generated.}

\item{output_file}{Optional. A file name for the PDF output. If NULL, interactive mode is assumed.}

\item{progress}{Optional. A progress object (e.g., from shiny::Progress) to report progress.}
}
\value{
In PDF mode, a PDF is created and the function returns NULL (invisibly).
In interactive mode, a (possibly nested) list of recorded plots is returned.
}
\description{
This function performs PCA on cytokine data and generates several types of plots:
2D individuals plot, optionally a 3D scatter plot (if style is "3d" and comp_num is 3),
a scree plot, loadings plots for each component, a biplot (using the default stats::biplot),
and a correlation circle plot.
}
\details{
In PDF mode (if output_file or output_file is provided) the plots are printed to a PDF.
In interactive mode (if both output_file and output_file are NULL) the plots are captured using recordPlot()
and returned as a list for display in Shiny.
}
\examples{
data <- ExampleData1[, -c(3,23)]
data_df <- dplyr::filter(data, Group != "ND" & Treatment != "Unstimulated")
# Run PCA analysis and save plots to a PDF file
cyt_pca(
  data = data_df,
  output_file = NULL,
  pca_colors = c("black", "red2"),
  scale = "log2",
  comp_num = 3,
  pch_values = c(16, 4),
  style = "3D",
  group_col = "Group",
  group_col2 = "Treatment",
  ellipse = FALSE
)
