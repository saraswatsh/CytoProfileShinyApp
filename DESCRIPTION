Description: CytoProfileShinyApp is an interactive Shiny application for comprehensive cytokine profiling analysis.
    It supports quality control by applying biologically meaningful cutoffs on raw cytokine measurements and 
    employs tests for distributional symmetry to recommend suitable data transformations. The application 
    provides a suite of exploratory and advanced analytical tools including summary statistics, enhanced boxplots,
    barplots, univariate tests, multivariate techniques (e.g. PCA, sPLS-DA), Random Forest classification, and 
    Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These capabilities facilitate in-depth analysis and visualization of cytokine data.
